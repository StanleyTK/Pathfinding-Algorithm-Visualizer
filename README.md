# Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer

Pathfinding algorithsm are a method of finding a route between two nodes. They are used in wide different range of applications, from finding the locations in the map, to social networking applications. I built this pathfinding algorithm visualizer because I wanted to do more research on pathfinding algorithms and to research how they really work. This program demonstrates the how the most used algorithms works and visualizes them in a 2D table.

## Algorithms Used in this program

Dijkstra's Algorithm: This algorithm is also known as the father of pathfiding algorithms. This algorithm guarentees the shortest path between the start node and the end node. 

A* Search Algorithm: Uses heuristic to guarnantee the shortest path, much faster than Dijkstra's Algorithm


## What's next for Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer

The immediate future of P.A.V. lies in better UI Design. However, in the long term future, I hope to add more algorithms such as DFS and BFS, and more functionalities such as changing the colors, and being able to select the start and end node.
