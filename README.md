# Pathfinding-Algorithm-Visualizer



This application allows you to draw the maze yourself, and solves the maze through different algorithms.

This program uses 2 algorithms:

Dijkstra's Algorithm: The father of pathfinding algorithms: guarentees the shortest path

A* Search Algorithm: Uses heuristic to guarnantee the shortest path, much faster than Dijkstra's Algorithm
